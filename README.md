# MaxMSP
A collection of Max MSP Patches I have created:

1) Random Percussion Generator
   - A patch which generates 2 separate rhythm lines of percussion based on the same notes.
   - This patch requires you to input your percussion plugins upon loading at the "plug" messages on the right hand side of the patch

2) Engravings
   - This patch recreates the opening of Engravings by Ethan Bortlick
   - This patch requires you to input the melody plugin, broken chord plugin, bass note plugin and drum kick plugin.
